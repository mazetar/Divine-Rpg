Divine Rpg
==========

This is the repo for my attempt at updating the Divine RPG mod to work with mc version 1.6.X

The repo's code builds upon the code from the old development team.

None of the current coders of this project worked on the earlier dev team though so it's an interesting and bumpy ride!


To do list
===

Write some documentation on how we want stuff to be organized and where to find stuff.

Write information about the project.

Write a better readme file.
